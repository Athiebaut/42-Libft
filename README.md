Libft

Libft is a foundational C project from the 42 curriculum.
Its goal is to build a personal C library by reimplementing essential standard functions, as well as additional utilities for string manipulation, memory management, and linked lists.
This library is designed to be reused in future projects and helps develop a deep understanding of how low-level C functions work under the hood.
