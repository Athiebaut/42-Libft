Libft

Libft is a foundational project from the 42 curriculum focused on building a personal C library from scratch.
The project aims to strengthen core programming fundamentals by reimplementing commonly used utility functions and creating reusable tools for future projects.

Beyond the technical aspect, Libft emphasizes code reliability, memory management, and a deep understanding of low-level behavior in C. By recreating essential utilities instead of relying on existing libraries, the project encourages precise reasoning about pointers, memory allocation, and string manipulation.

Libft serves as a long-term foundation throughout the curriculum, promoting clean architecture, consistent coding practices, and reusable design — all essential skills for robust C development.
